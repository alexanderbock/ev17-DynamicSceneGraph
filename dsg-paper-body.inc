\section{Introduction}
Thanks to humanity's collective discoveries of the world around us,
we are now aware of structures in the universe that are both tiny and huge.
The observable universe has a diameter of approximately $10^{27}$ meters,
while the Planck length, which is the length where quantum mechanical effects
make it impossible to distinguish between two physical locations, is approximately 
$10^{-35}$ meters.\\

Comprehending the vast differences of scales in the known universe is needless 
to say a huge challenge for us humans. Computer graphics and visualization have
prooven to be immensively valuable tools for communicating scientific findings
and contextualizing informaiton. However, even in our virtual worlds, huge scale
differences are difficult to represent, due to limitations in numeric precision
in state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures.

\section{Limitations of the Traditional Rendering Pipeline}
- Floating point numbers \\
- Catastrophic cancellation \\
- depth buffer precision \\

\section{Related work}
Hanson et Al. introduces the concept of Power scaled coordinates, where ... \\

Prominent examples of applications where huge scale differences are visualized 
together include movie productions, such as "Powers of Ten" [citaition needed],
All We Are [citation needed], as well as interactive software for digital planetariums,
notable examples being Uniview from Sciss, DigiStar from Evans and Sutherland, [citations and more examples].
