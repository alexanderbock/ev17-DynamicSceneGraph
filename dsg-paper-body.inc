\section{Introduction}
Thanks to humanity's collective discoveries of the world around us,
we are now aware of structures in the universe that are both tiny and huge.
The observable universe has a diameter of approximately $10^{27}$ meters,
while the Planck length, which is the length where quantum mechanical effects
make it impossible to distinguish between two physical locations, is approximately 
$10^{-35}$ meters.

Comprehending the vast differences of scales in the known universe is needless 
to say a huge challenge for us humans. Computer graphics and visualization have
prooven to be immensively valuable tools for communicating scientific findings
and contextualizing informaiton. However, even in our virtual worlds, huge scale
differences are difficult to represent, due to limitations in numeric precision
in state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures.

In movie productions and visualziation software with limited interaction possibilies,
producers and developers may use various compositing techniques to blend
between large and small scenes, to account for the individual cases where a transition
between scales is required. Allowing the user to navigate around in a dataset with more
freedom requires a more general system that can handle scale differences automatically.

\section{The Traditional Rendering Pipeline}
The co-evolution of graphics hardware, software and content, largely pushed forward by
the gaming industry has led to modern graphics processing units that are optimized for
operating efficiently on floating point numbers, vectors and matrices.
In a standard computer graphics pipleline, $4x4$ matrices are used to represent coordinate
transformations operating on 4-dimensional homogenious coordinate vectors.

\subsection{Scene Graphs}
In software, matrices are commonly generated from a scene graph structure, allowing developers
to represent transformations hierarchically. Each node in the graph may contain a
coordinate transform, also affecting all its children. To transform an object from its
local coordinate system to a global \emph{world coordinate system}, the transformation matrices
of the ancestor nodes are concatonated to a \emph{model matrix} using matrix multiplication. 

An additional \emph{view matrix} is also commonly generated based on a camera position and rotation expressed in the world coordinate system, and then used to transtorm world coordinates to \emph{view coordinates}.

\subsection{Floating point numbers}
The widely used IEEE754 standard for representing floating point numbers deals with scale
differences by representing values as a sign, mantissa and exponent. The IEEE754
single precision floating point format uses 1 sign bit $s$, 8 exponent bits $e_i$ and 23 mantissa bits $m_i$.
The value $v$ represented by these bits can be epressed as in equation \ref{floatingpoint}, with a few exceptions including zero, infinity and denormal numbers (TODO.)

\begin{equation} \label{floatingpoint}
v = (-1)^s \cdot (1 + \sum_{i = 1}^{23}b_{23 - i} 2^{-i}) \cdot 2^{e-127}
\end{equation}
