Dear reviewers,

We would like to thank the reviewers for the many valuable comments we have received on
our submission. During the revision, we did our best to address all of the issues brought
up and revise the manuscript accordingly. Below, you will find our detailed responses to
the reviews together with accounts of the performed changes. The remainder of this cover
letter is structured as follows: First, we cite comments from the review, then we
summarize the changes in the manuscript to adhere to these comments. All replies are
structured based on the specific reviewers. If multiple reviewers raised the same concern,
this point is only discussed at the first appearance and omitted later. All references to
sections and figures relate to the new layout in the revised submission.

We hope that all your comments have been sufficiently addressed in this revised manuscript.

Sincerely yours,
    The Authors.

We moved the contents of the appendix into the theory section to improve the flow of the
paper and to mitigate confusion related to concepts and notation being introduced in the
appendix but used in the body of the paper.

We added references to section in order to related and delineate our work from the 
previous work in the field of level of detail and other multiresolution methods. To our
knowledge, none of the previously published methods deal with the problems of floating
point inaccuracies and their causes

In order to address this valid concern, we included additional explanations in the
introduction, the beginning of the results sections, as well as providing avenues for
future work. Furthermore, we included more potential avenues for future research in the
end of the manuscript, especially dealing with the integration of datasets that span large
extents both spatially and temporally, which is possible due to our proposed method.

We added discussions about the performance implications of our method in multiple places
throughout the manuscript;  the end of section 4, section 4.2, and the results section.
